# roofrepair
The repair in a small part of my roof performed in June 2017 

Project Phases

The was a quantity of mineral deposits in an outside part of 
a brick decorated wall in the outside of my house.
This finding indicated that water was somehow passed through the roof and routed
to the external surface of the wall. There were no findings inside the house. 

After visiting the roof and near the first chimney you could easily feel that 
the roof woods in some parts were rotten. 

The photographs cover the projects phases
